Parity.org Launches 2020 Best Companies for Women to Advance List  

NEW YORK, July 13, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Parity.org today announced the [Best Companies for Women to Advance List 2020](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=2855725-1&h=2255978691&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.parity.org%2Fthe-list%2F&a=Best+Companies+for+Women+to+Advance+List+2020). Thirty-five companies made the list, including S&P 500 companies Adobe, AmerisourceBergen, Best Buy, the Clorox Company, Nasdaq, PepsiCo, and Ralph Lauren Corporation. Parity.org, a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization focused on bringing gender equality to the highest levels of business, established the Best Companies for Women to Advance List to recognize organizations that have benefits, policies, and programs that are particularly beneficial for women to advance in the workplace.

"We are thrilled to announce the Best Companies for Women to Advance List 2020," said Cathrin Stickney, Parity.org founder and CEO. "These companies are examples of commitment and intentionality in leveling the playing field for women and paving the way for them to succeed and advance their careers, making gender parity at the top levels possible. The efforts they have undertaken are not just worth recognizing, they are worth emulating. We hope that more companies will follow their lead and take similar actions to pave the way for the women in their organization to advance."

Companies on the 2020 list share several common best practices, including work-from-home or telecommute options (92%), flexible working hours (82%), and equal paid family leave for men and women (73%). Companies that made the list were also very likely to measure and report on gender parity to the executive team (95%) and/or board (68%).

Among these companies, there was also a strong relationship between having gender parity on the board of directors and having a female CEO. Where more than 50% of board directors are composed of women, we found 67% have a female CEO.
