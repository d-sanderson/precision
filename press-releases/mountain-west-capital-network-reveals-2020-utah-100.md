MountainWest Capital Network Reveals 2020 Utah 100  

SALT LAKE CITY, Sept. 10, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- MountainWest Capital Network (MWCN) today released the 2020 Utah 100, its annual list of the fastest-growing companies in Utah. A list of the Utah 100 companies in alphabetical order follows, and MWCN will introduce its ranked list during the 26th annual Utah 100 Awards ceremony on Tuesday, October 13, 2020. Due to health restrictions related to COVID-19, this year's ceremony will be held virtually, allowing a broader audience to attend. MWCN has also determined the companies featured in its Top 15 Revenue and Emerging Elite categories, listed alphabetically below, which will also be ranked at the awards event.

"Assembling this list each year is one of the highlights for MWCN. Along with recognizing some of the amazing companies in our state, we are also able to follow where business continues to thrive and new industries enter our market," said Ryan J. Dent, chairman of the MWCN Utah 100 committee. "This list is a great reminder of the strength of Utah's economy, particularly as we continue to recover from the shutdowns necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic."

Introduced in 1994, the Utah 100 Award draws more than 1,000 business leaders every year and is the flagship event for the MountainWest Capital Network. Broadcaster, author and retired NBA star Thurl Bailey will present a keynote address at the event, where the final Utah 100 rankings will be released.

Utah 100 honorees are ranked according to a weighted average revenue calculation of percentage and dollar growth over a five year period through December 2019, while those in the Top 15 Revenue category are ranked based on the highest total dollar growth over the same five year period. Companies are only allowed to be recognized in one category.
